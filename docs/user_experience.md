# **Veydra – User Experience & Driving Modes**

Veydra’s user experience (UX) philosophy centers on clarity, confidence, and driver control.  
Instead of overwhelming the driver with gimmicks, Veydra provides a clean, intuitive, and purposeful interface that adapts to the situation.

This document outlines the driving modes, the unique **Defensive Mode**, the cabin interaction model, displays, controls, and the overall UX design philosophy.

# 🎛️ **1. UX Philosophy**

### **1.1 Calm by Default**
The vehicle should feel:
- Predictable  
- Quiet  
- Easy to understand  
- Mentally low-load  

No unnecessary animations, noises, or “digital chaos.”

### **1.2 Intelligent When Needed**
Systems activate only when they serve a purpose:
- AeroBrake only deploys when it matters  
- Driver assists engage smoothly  
- Displays highlight relevant information at relevant times  

### **1.3 Human-First Design**
Controls prioritize:
- Tactile feedback  
- Intuitive placement  
- Minimal distraction  
- Predictable responses

# 🚗 **2. Driving Modes Overview**

Veydra supports five primary modes.  
All modes share the same physical limits but adjust responsiveness, regen, steering weights, and safety system behaviors.

---

# **Mode 1: Comfort**
Everyday driving mode.

### Characteristics:
- Smooth throttle response  
- Moderate regen  
- Softer steering profile  
- Quieter cabin (adaptive acoustic management)  
- Balanced energy use  

Ideal for commuting and general travel.

---

# **Mode 2: Sport**
More responsive and dynamic.

### Characteristics:
- Sharper throttle mapping  
- Stronger regen for “one-pedal” potential  
- More aggressive torque vectoring  
- Tighter steering feedback  
- Reduced stability intervention  

Sport mode maintains efficiency goals but prioritizes driver engagement.

---

# **Mode 3: Eco**
Maximizes range and energy efficiency.

### Characteristics:
- Soft throttle mapping  
- Highest regen efficiency  
- Reduced climate system load  
- Predictive energy management  
- Recommended speeds via eco-HUD cues  

Eco is not restrictive — it simply optimizes the system.

---

# **Mode 4: Custom**
User-configurable mode.

Drivers can tune:
- Regen strength  
- Steering feel  
- Throttle response  
- Brake blending  
- Torque split (AWD model)  

Custom mode allows personalization without complexity.

---

# 🚨 **Mode 5: Defensive Mode**  
A unique Veydra feature designed for pre-emptive safety.

### **Purpose**
If the driver anticipates a dangerous situation — heavy traffic, icy roads, a distracted driver behind them — they can **manually engage Defensive Mode**.

### **Activation Results**
When engaged:
- Seat belts pre-tension  
- AeroBrake system primes for near-instant deployment  
- Extra safety thresholds are enabled in sensor fusion  
- Torque mapping becomes more conservative  
- Stability control becomes more sensitive  
- External hazards are highlighted in the HUD  

### **Predictive Capabilities**
Even before ABS or ESC intervene, Defensive Mode is readying the vehicle to react.

---

# 🧩 **3. Interior Interaction Model**

### **3.1 Physical Controls Where They Matter**
Critical functions have tactile controls:
- Volume  
- Drive mode selector  
- Wipers  
- Climate basics  
- Hazard lights  

These remain usable without looking.

### **3.2 Digital UI for Complex Functions**
More advanced functions live on the central display:
- Module configuration  
- Navigation  
- Media  
- Energy management  
- Settings  

### **3.3 HUD-Focused Information**
The heads-up display shows:
- Speed  
- Navigation cues  
- Safety alerts  
- Regen feedback  
- AeroBrake status (when active)  

The HUD reduces eye movement and cognitive load.

---

# 🖥️ **4. Displays & Feedback Systems**

### **4.1 Central Display**
- High-contrast  
- Not overloaded with widgets  
- Clean typography  
- Driver-first layouts  

### **4.2 Instrument Cluster / Mini-Cluster**
Even in simplified form, Veydra provides:
- Speed  
- Selected mode  
- Battery & regen info  
- Safety alerts  

### **4.3 Contextual Feedback**
When braking hard:
- Regen meter expands  
- AeroBrake status flashes briefly  

When in Eco Mode:
- Efficiency suggestions fade gently onto the HUD  

When in Sport Mode:
- Cornering and torque vector indicators appear discreetly  

---

# 🧠 **5. Smart Assist Systems**

### **5.1 Sensor Fusion**
Combines:
- Camera  
- Radar  
- Ultrasonic  
- Vehicle motion data  

Used for:
- Emergency braking  
- Defensive Mode prediction  
- Adaptive cruise assist  
- Blind-spot detection  
- Parking assistance  

### **5.2 Adaptive Alerts**
Alerts scale with urgency:
- Mild → soft tones, HUD highlights  
- Moderate → stronger tone, steering wheel haptic cue  
- Severe → loud alert + automatic braking  

---

# 🔋 **6. Energy & Range Display**

Designed to reduce anxiety and improve understanding:
- Predictive remaining range  
- Regen contribution estimation  
- Driving mode impact  
- Module (pod/roof) impact on aero and range  

---

# 📦 **7. Module Interaction (Pods, Roof, Interior)**

When a module is attached:
- The vehicle recognizes it  
- Adjusts aerodynamic modeling  
- Updates range predictions  
- Reconfigures sensor blind spots  
- Enables relevant UI options  

Example:  
If an Adventure Pod is installed, the UI shows anchor point load limits and additional utility options.

---

# 🧭 **8. Summary**

Veydra’s user experience is designed to make the vehicle:
- Safer  
- Simpler  
- More intuitive  
- More adaptive  
- More enjoyable to drive  

The combination of clean interface design, purposeful driving modes, and the unique Defensive Mode sets the vehicle’s UX apart from conventional EVs.
