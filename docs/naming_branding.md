# **Veydra – Naming & Branding Overview**

The name **Veydra** was chosen to reflect the vehicle’s purpose, personality, and engineering philosophy.  
It is modern, distinctive, and easy to pronounce, yet does not rely on existing automotive naming conventions or legacy associations.

This document explains the branding logic behind the name, the intended identity of the Veydra project, and the visual/tonal direction for the overall brand.

- Ownable  
- Timeless  
- Globally pronounceable  

The phonetics convey qualities central to the vehicle’s design.

# 🧩 **3. Branding Themes**

Veydra’s brand identity should support three core themes:

### **3.1 Modernism Through Engineering**
The vehicle is intentionally:
- Clean  
- Elegant  
- Purpose-driven  

Brand visuals should mirror this precision.
