# **Veydra – Architecture & Platform Overview**

Veydra is built on a clean-sheet, EV-native architecture with the structural battery pack serving as the foundation of the chassis. Every major component — suspension, motors, body structure, crash systems — is designed around this energy floor.

This document outlines the platform layout, load paths, structural philosophy, and core engineering concepts behind the Veydra architecture.

## 🧱 **1. Structural Battery Floor**

### **1.1 Concept**
The battery is not a cargo box bolted under the car.  
It *is* the car’s primary structural element.

The pack is built as a **sandwich beam**, consisting of:
- Upper floor skin (interior surface)
- Structural core containing modules, ribs, and thermal channels
- Lower impact-resistant underbody skin

This provides:
- High bending stiffness  
- High torsional rigidity  
- Low center of gravity  
- A completely flat interior floor  

The structural battery eliminates the need for:
- Transmission tunnels  
- Large front engine bays  
- Heavy ladder- or frame-style structures

## 🏗️ **2. Platform Perimeter Structure**

Surrounding the energy floor is a rigid perimeter frame:

### **2.1 Side Sills**
Tall, multi-chamber sills:
- Carry crash and bending loads  
- Tie into the A, B, and C pillars  
- Shield the battery from intrusion  
- Provide structural hardpoints for seats, belts, and modules  

### **2.2 Crossmembers**
Front and rear crossmembers:
- Support e-axle mounting  
- Tie into subframes and suspension  
- Route crash loads around the battery zone  

These elements work with the battery floor to create a closed structural loop.

## ⚙️ **3. Drivetrain Integration**

### **3.1 E-Axle Modules**
Veydra uses modular e-axles:

- Motor  
- Inverter  
- Reduction gear  
- Differential (if needed)  
- Cooling interfaces  

They bolt directly to reinforced points on the crossmembers.

**Configurations:**
- Rear-wheel drive (standard)
- All-wheel drive (dual e-axle configuration)

### **3.2 Motor Placement**
Motors are mounted *inboard* to:
- Reduce unsprung mass  
- Simplify cooling  
- Lower polar moment for better handling  

---

## 🌀 **4. Suspension & Hardpoints**

Suspension components attach to the perimeter frame, not the battery:

### **Front Suspension**
- Compact double wishbone or MacPherson strut  
- Subframe attached to the front crossmember and sills  

### **Rear Suspension**
- Multi-link independent system  
- Subframe attached to the rear crossmember and sills  

### **Benefits**
- Precise wheel control  
- Reduced NVH  
- Improved crash isolation  
- No suspension loads transmitted through the battery interior

## 🔥 **5. Thermal Spine Architecture**

Running longitudinally through the pack is a **thermal spine** that contains:
- Coolant manifolds  
- Pumps and valves  
- Thermal fusing  
- Interfaces to motors, inverters, and HVAC  

This keeps thermal routing centralized and easy to service.

---

## 🧊 **6. Battery Safety & Zoning**

The battery pack is divided into **multiple zones**, each with:
- Local sensors  
- Local disconnect capability  
- Fault isolation devices  
- Temperature boundaries  

In a crash or internal fault:
- Affected zones can be isolated  
- HV system can discharge safely  
- Venting routes gases away from the cabin  

This improves both occupant and pack safety.

## 🚧 **7. Crash Structures**

Crash structures are designed *around* the energy floor.

### **7.1 Front Structure**
- Progressive crush rails  
- Upper load paths routed over the pack  
- Lower load paths routed under the pack  
- Energy steered away from the battery interior  

### **7.2 Side Structure**
- Multi-wall sills  
- Lateral crush zones between sill and battery modules  
- Cross-beams linking left and right sides  

### **7.3 Rear Structure**
- Deformation zones sized to protect rear modules and motors  
- Rear crossmember engineered to prevent intrusion into battery  

All three zones create a balanced crash management system.

## 🪶 **8. Materials Strategy**

Veydra uses a mixed-material approach to optimize:
- Stiffness  
- Weight  
- Crash energy absorption  
- Manufacturability  

Likely materials include:
- Aluminum extrusions (sills, crossmembers)
- High-strength steel (crash beams, pillars)
- Composites (underbody, roof, certain modules)
- Structural adhesives + mechanical fasteners for hybrid joints

---

## 🧩 **9. Body "Top Hat" Structure**

The “top hat” (the body above the floor) is designed to be **modular**:
- Rear modules attach to a standardized rear interface  
- Roof modules attach to integrated roof rails  
- Interior modules lock into floor mounting rails  

The top hat contributes to:
- Aerodynamic form  
- Passenger safety  
- Structural support  

But it is not the primary load-bearing element — the floor is.

## 🧬 **10. Architectural Summary**

Veydra’s platform can be summarized as:

- A **structural energy floor** acting as the chassis  
- Reinforced **perimeter frame** handling suspension and crash loads  
- Modular **e-axles** for simple RWD/AWD configurations  
- A centralized **thermal spine**  
- A **modular top structure** for reconfigurable body forms  
- Safety built through **smart structures** and **load routing**, not mass  

This architecture unlocks the full potential of EV design by separating itself from legacy combustion layouts completely.
