# 📐 3. Style Guidelines

### **Documentation Style**
- Use clear, technical language when appropriate  
- Prefer Markdown formatting  
- Keep sections well-organized  
- Avoid overclaiming; keep analysis grounded in known physics  

### **Naming Conventions**
- Filenames: lowercase, hyphens or underscores  
- Directories: lowercase  
- Images: descriptive, lowercase filenames  

### **Technical Accuracy**
Contributors should cite reputable sources or state when something is theoretical or proposed.
